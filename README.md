# Project - Netflix Movies Analysis

This project analyzes the durations of movies on Netflix by year of release and marking non-feature films (<= 60 minutes long) by genres. 

## About the Datasets
I have used two different datasets (courtesy of Datacamp).

1. **‘netflix_data.csv’** contains data about the different titles on Netflix. The show id, type (movie or TV show), relevant information about the title such as name of the feature, the director, cast, country of production, release year, length, genre, a brief description date, and the date when the feature was added to Netflix are the attributes describing the records in the table.
