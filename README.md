2. **‘color_data.csv’** contains data about the colors for different titles. It is a categorical value that will help in data visualizations.

2. Many short movies have been released in the past **two decades**. Some of these films are **under an hour long!**

3. Many of the films that are **under 60 minutes** fall into genres such as **"Children"**, **"Stand-Up"**, and **"Documentaries"**. These types of films are probably often shorter than **90 minute Hollywood blockbuster**.

4. People have
