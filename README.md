# Project - Netflix Movies Analysis

This project analyzes the durations of movies on Netflix by year of release and marking non-feature films (<= 60 minutes long) by genres. 

## About the Datasets
I have used two different datasets (courtesy of Datacamp).

1. **‘netflix_data.csv’** contains data about the different titles on Netflix .
